Q1 -> What is Emmet?

Answer -> Emmet is a tool/plugin that helps to write HTML,CSS etc faster by using simple abbreviations that are then converted into codeblocks.

Examples:-> 
div.demo => <div className="demo"></div>
div#demo => <div id="demo"></div>
ul>li>div => <ul><li><div></div></li></ul>

It is a built in feature of VSCode. But it dont support .jsx files by default

Q2 -> Difference between a Library and Framework?

Ans -> Library takes minimum effort to put it into our code.
One key difference between libraries and frameworks is that libraries are called by the application code, while frameworks call the application
code. In other words,when you use a library, you are in control of how and when it is used. With a framework, the framework is in control and 
dictates how the code should be organized and used.

Q3 -> What is CDN? Why do we use it? 

Ans -> Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers located in different geographical locations that are used to deliver content to
users based on their geographic location. CDNs are used to improve the performance and availability of websites and applications by serving 
content from servers that are closer to the user, reducing the distance the data has to travel and minimizing latency.
CDNs are used for a variety of purposes, including:

a. Improving the speed of web pages: By serving content from a server that is physically closer to the user, CDNs can significantly improve the
   loading speed of web pages.

b. Reducing bandwidth costs: CDNs can reduce the amount of bandwidth required by a website or application by serving cached copies of content
   from servers located closer to the user.

c. Enhancing security: CDNs can provide additional security measures such as DDoS protection and SSL encryption, helping to protect websites
   and applications from attacks.

d. Improving availability: CDNs can help to improve the availability of a website or application by providing multiple copies of content that 
   can be served to users if one server goes down.

e. CDNs are used by a wide range of websites and applications, including e-commerce sites, media and entertainment platforms, and software as a
   service (SaaS) providers.

Q4 -> Why is React known as React?

Ans -> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed and open-sourced by Facebook in 2013.
It is known as React because it was designed to help developers "react" to changes in the state of an application,
by efficiently rendering and updating the UI in response to those changes.

React is designed to be declarative, meaning that developers specify what the UI should look like based on the current state of the application
and React takes care of updating the UI as needed. This allows developers to focus on building the logic of the application rather than worrying
about how to update the UI efficiently.

Q5 -> What is crossorigin in script tag?

Ans -> The crossorigin attribute is used in the script tag to indicate that the script should be loaded from a different origin (domain, protocol,
 or port) than the current page. This is used to allow web pages to load resources from a different domain, while still allowing the browser 
 to apply security measures such as the same-origin policy.

The crossorigin attribute can be set to either anonymous or use-credentials. If set to anonymous, the browser will include an Origin header
with the request, but will not send any cookies or other credentials. If set to use-credentials, the browser will include credentials with the
request.

The crossorigin attribute is often used to allow web pages to load resources such as fonts or scripts from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
It can also be used to allow web pages to access APIs or other resources from a different domain.

For example, the following script tag includes the crossorigin attribute to allow the script to be loaded from a different origin:

<script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Q6 -> What is diference between React and ReactDOM ? 

Ans -> React and ReactDOM are two separate libraries that are often used together in the development of web applications with React.

React is designed to be declarative in nature, it means it is allowing developers to specify how UI should look like depending on the current
state of the application. Basically react takes the complete responsibility of managing any updates to the DOM in case application state changes.
Only those components are re-rendered that are actually changed using Virtual DOM & Reconcillation
ReactDOM is an interface b/w DOM and React which provides functions to render/add or update react elements on the DOM effectively.
The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside
the React model if you need to.

Q7 -> What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN? 

Ans: react.development.js and react.production.js are two different versions of the React library that are available via CDN (Content Delivery 
Network). These files contain the same code, but are optimized for different environments and have different features enabled.

The react.development.js file is intended for use during development and includes additional features and debugging tools that can be helpful
when building and testing React applications. These features may include additional warning messages, error checking, and other tools that can 
help identify problems or potential issues with the code.

The react.production.js file, on the other hand, is intended for use in production environments and has been optimized for performance and size.
It does not include the additional debugging tools and may have other features disabled in order to reduce the size of the file and improve 
performance.

Q8-> Async & Defer attribute?

The async attribute tells the browser to download the script in the background while the page is still loading(html parsing), and to execute 
the script as soon as it is available. This can improve the loading speed of the page, as the script does not block the rendering of the page 
while it is being downloaded. However, the script may not necessarily be executed in the order it appears in the HTML, as it may be executed 
as soon as it is available.

The defer attribute tells the browser to download the script in the background while the page is still loading, but to execute the script only
after the page has finished loading. This can also improve the loading speed of the page, as the script does not block the rendering of the
page. However, unlike async, defer ensures that the script is executed in the order it appears in the HTML.

Both async and defer are used to improve the performance and loading speed of web pages by allowing scripts to be loaded and executed in a
non-blocking manner. However, they have different behaviors and may be more suitable for different use cases.

Async can be used if the scripts are independent of each other like google-analytics while defer can be used if scripts are dependent
on each other.
